# 3D-Interactive-Animation

This project shows how you can integrate Splineâ€™s 3D capabilities with modern web development technologies to create interactive and visually rich animations. Using GSAP for smooth transitions and text animations enhances the overall user experience, while Tailwind CSS helps keep the styling clean and responsive.
